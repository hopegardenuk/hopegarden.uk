All the latest CAD files and PDFs are kept on the Hope Garden repository at:

I like to use [Free Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), and my favourite CAD program is [QCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)

If you would like to learn CAD (ie you are designing more than a couple of gardens) I have a beginners CAD course which only costs Â£1, and it's yours for **free** with the code `REMARKABLYFREE`.
