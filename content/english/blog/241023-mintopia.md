Ysgol Cilgerran, via the Hope Garden, is going to take part in the [IntMintMint Challenge](https://mintopia.bigcartel.com/intmintmint-challenge) run by Si Poole.

[Dr Si Poole](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8869-7356), whose day job is Associate Professor of Cultural Education at [Chester University](https://www.chester.ac.uk/), has a [national collection of Mint](https://www.plantheritage.org.uk/national-plant-collections/search-the-national-plant-collections/collection/5504/mentha) in [Cheshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire). 

The IntMintMint challenge is for schools. Each participating child receives a specific mint cultivar, and they have to nurture and propagate the mint. The challenge is to *trade* the plant with other schools, and the more you trade, the more points and badges you accumulate.

[Mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentha) is a fascinating genus of plants of about a dozen or so species and hundreds of cultivars. They are easy to propagate and like rich, moist soils, which means they are ideal for growing in schools. They are also fragrant, familiar and floriferous, making them even more attractive to school children and pollinators.
