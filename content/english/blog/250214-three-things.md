These are the three principles I like to apply when thinking about wildlife forest garden design and ecology.

## 3 principles

1. Structural **complexity**
2. Native species **diversity**
3. Low impact **productivity**

### 1. Structural complexity

This phrase comes from wildlife gardener [John Little](https://www.grassroofcompany.co.uk), a massive inspiration. The idea is that by creating structural complexity in a garden or a landscape, you create more habitat. Have a look at this video for more:

What this means is **build habitat into the infrastructure of your garden**.

### 2. Native

The larval forms of invertebrates are way more likely to native plants because theyâ€˜ve co-evolved. Have a look at [Database of Insects and their Food Plants]() to see a list of interactions. Eg Hawthorn [197 interactions](http://dbif.brc.ac.uk/hostsresults.aspx?hostid=1665) vs Japanese Maple [1 interaction](http://dbif.brc.ac.uk/hostsresults.aspx?hostid=74)

What this means is **use native plants where possible**, in bulk eg as ground cover plants or in hedging.

### 3. Productivity

In the absence of large herbivores, diversity requires humans to make low impact interventions. Take the case of the wooded meadow, which has both structural complexity *and* low impact land management, and they are amongst the [most biodiverse landscapes in the world](https://grwd.cc/paper-when-culture-supports-biodiversity).

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1725903800/240828-wood-meadow.jpg" alt="Wooded meadow" caption="Estonian wood meadow, immensely diverse & productive" >}}

What this means is that *humans can be a force for good*, and balanced interventions can be beneficial.
