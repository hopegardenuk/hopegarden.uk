Like many people in Wales, I seem to have several projects on the go simultaneously! One of the most marvellous things about working on the Hope Garden has been the opportunity to meet and work with some very talented and passionate people. And there has also been a great deal of crossover of ideas and projects between different agencies and organisations.

My other main job is working as a Biodiversity Assistant for Ceredigion Nature Partnership at [Ceredigion Council](https://ceredigion.gov.uk). I was tasked setting up a grassland group [Glaswelltir Ceredigion](http://glaswelltirceredigion.cymru), which I‘ve done thanks to so much support from other grassland groups and environmental charities.  

After the wildlife ID workshop with the most excellent Yusef Samari from West Wales Biodiversity Information Centre ([WWBIC](https://www.wwbic.org.uk)), I thought we could use the same ideas for Glaswelltir Ceredigion, partnering schools with owners of grassland within walking distance of the school for regular visits to record wildlife observations.

This application has involved working with some fabulous partners, including [Plantlife Cymru](https://www.plantlife.org.uk/about-us/plantlife-cymru/), [Wildlife Trust of South & West Wales](https://www.welshwildlife.org), [Keep Wales Tidy](https://keepwalestidy.cymru), [The Buzz Club](https://www.thebuzzclub.uk) and [WWBIC](https://www.wwbic.org.uk), and I found out yesterday that the application was successful, leading to even more ideas for more connected and networked projects.

For me, this is a really positive story about how benefits from one project can spill out into others.
