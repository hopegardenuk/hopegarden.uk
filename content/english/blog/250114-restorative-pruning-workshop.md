Considering the weather, a considerable crowd gathered for the pruning workshop on a cold Saturday. [Martin Hayes](https://www.theapplemancan.uk/) has been designing, planting and pruning orchards for many years and is much sought after for his engaging, no-nonsense approach.

All gardens, even forest gardens, need managing, and pruning is *essential* for pretty much any domesticated fruit tree. This is because they have been bred for producing fruit and grafted on to different [rootstocks](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/rootstocks/) (a rootstock determines the height and vigour of the tree). If they‚Äôre not pruned, fruit trees will gradually produce less fruit, and there is a real risk of branches being damaged by over-bearing fruit.

The workshop took place over 4 sites in Cilgerran: the orchard by the [Hope Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GABEMK8aauZ9Rfay8), the [Fruit & Nut Community Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2VEriW6SfkDkAXVt6), the village [Parc y Pwmp](https://maps.app.goo.gl/c3iVouK6EM4qwNC27) and the orchard by the [Welsh wildlife centre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AKT4Hf9LXz6gtPxj9). All except Fruit & Nut have been neglected for a few years, so the workshop was really about *restorative pruning*.

Normally you‚Äôd prune in the third year, if you‚Äôve planted a young tree, and then prune lightly each year. On many of the trees, Martin had to cut back quite drastically, to rescue the tree and not be concerned about the fruiting this year. This really emphasises that all gardening is a work in progress, and we need well-trained gardeners to look after fruit trees year after year. Many of the attendees live in or around Cilgerran, so we‚Äôre lucky to have a pool of enthusiastic pruners to help out.

I have been on several workshops but I still took lots of notes, there is always something to learn. Go and book yourself on a pruning workshop near you now!

The key points for me were:

- It‚Äòs *all* about redirecting the flow of sap to change the tree
- Only dig a planting hole as big as the roots
- Plant for final size (know your [rootstocks](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/rootstocks/))
- The Xmas tree shape is the simplest and most productive, with a central leader üéÑ
- Prune any Prunus tree (plum, cherry, apricot etc) *after* the ‚ÄúJune drop‚Äú
- Prune apples and pears any time of year, although prune in winter for fruit (where the buds are) and summer for wood (shape)
- Keep the central leader *central*!
- A ‚Äúdog leg‚Äù traps the sap down and encourages low growth
- A ‚Äúsap riser‚Äú encourages upright growth
- Always think of how the tree will fruit
- Cut back to something, either a leaf or a flower bud
- Think 3 years ahead when pruning
- Keep your options open, tie vertical watershoots down to horizontal, or tuck them, because fruit is formed on more horizontal branches
- Don‚Äòt mulch with cardboard, as encourages mice, just woodchip, or even better, a low-growing perennial ground cover, so you won‚Äòt need to mow

We only managed to prune a few fruit trees on each site, so Martin has kindly agreed to make a return visit for ad hoc workshops. If you‚Äòd like to be notified, please sign up to the newsletter: [hopegarden.uk/newsletter](https://hopegarden.uk/newsletter)

We had lovely hot drink, spicey soup and fresh bread at the cafe. And then some more pruning and the most delicious cake baked by Jude and delivered by Callum. Thank you all for a really informative and engaging day.
