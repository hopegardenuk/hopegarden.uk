Yusef from West Wales Biodiversity Information Centre ran an [ecology survey](https://hopegarden.uk/species/) at the site of the Hope Garden. As part of the report, he detailed the species within a 1km radius of the garden using the [Aderyn online database](https://aderyn.lercwales.org.uk/public/search/results?latlng=&gridref=SA43+2TH+).

> This returned records of 7,484 records of 2,282 taxa, including 1,106 records of 256 protected / priority taxa

I’ll be using [Aderyn](https://aderyn.lercwales.org.uk/public/search) in combination with [Plant Atlas](https://plantatlas2020.org/), the [NBN Atlas](https://nbnatlas.org/) and [Database of Insects & their Food Plants](https://www.brc.ac.uk/dbif/hosts.aspx) to design with **species in mind**.
