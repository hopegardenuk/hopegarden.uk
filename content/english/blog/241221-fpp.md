We purchased a couple of [Fixed Point Photography](https://www.greatfen.org.uk/fixed-point-photography) brackets for the Hope Garden, from a company called [Landmark](https://madebylandmark.com/product/fixed-point-photography-stainless-steel-phone-cradle). The brackets are quite expensive but very well made, and they will enable us to document the progress of the Hope Garden.

The best view is from the gatepost of neighbouring Pen Y Foidr allotments. Yes, it‘s a bit wonky, I‘ll have to put in some spacers beneath the bracket to level it out!

The other vantage point is on a beautiful Oak fence post created by my old neighbour and woodworker Kingsley Hudson. However, I don‘t know how useful it will be, and I might move the bracket to a more inclusive view.
