Maybe because of the relatively low number of guests, the workshop at Cilgerran Village Hall felt really productive and engaged, and covered a lot of ground, explaining the ideas behind the community space in a wildlife forest garden that is the Hope Garden.

The slides are available forever-ish here [hopegarden.uk/slides/intro](https://hopegarden.uk/slides/intro/#2)

The workshop was in 4 parts.

## 1. [The ideas](https://hopegarden.uk/slides/intro/#8)
We are in a nature and climate emergency, and humans need to live in balance with nature, of which we are a part. How do we do that? How can we illuminate that path of balance? What changes do we need in how we make decisions? Originally, the Hope Garden was going to be a show garden at RHS Hampton Court, and event-within-an-event. It was decided that valuable experience and lessons could be learned from a real, **living** garden, benefitting real, living wildlife and people.

## 2. [What is a forest garden?](https://hopegarden.uk/slides/intro/#19)

The simplest definition is a growing edible crops in a wildlife garden. It’s essentially an edible ecosystem, a low-input garden that balances within itself the necessary nutrients and pest control. It’s characterised by perennial plants in different layers and permanent ground cover.

## 3. [What makes a wildlife garden?](https://hopegarden.uk/slides/intro/#37)

For my money, it’s **native plants where possible** and structural habitat for wildlife. The reason to grow native plants is because they have co-evolved with wildlife and form the foodstuff of invertebrates and the foundation of ecosystems.

## 4. [Why Community Assemblies?](https://hopegarden.uk/slides/intro/#56)

Many people say there is a democratic deficit in this country. Decisions are made with a bias towards established economic interests rather than with the participation of citizens. What if economic decision were democratic? What if more direct demcracy was embedded within our culture? Would it alter our approach to the nature and climate emergency?

At the national level, [Citizens Assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens'_assembly) have a proven track record of delivering on difficult decisions (can you imagine a permanent Citizens Assembly as the Upper House in the UK?!).

At a local level, Community Assemblies are an inclusive and open framework for decision making on specific issues. They are based on 3 pillars:
1. Radical inclusivity
2. Active listening
3. Trust the process

If there’s any demand, I might do a livestream of the workshop. Email me <hello@hopegarden.uk> if interested!
