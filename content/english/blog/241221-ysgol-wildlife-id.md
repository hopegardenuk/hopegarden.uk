We‘ve had some bad news and good news.

The bad news is that we weren‘t successful in our grant application to [Transition Bro Gwaun‘s Community Climate Fund](https://transitionbrogwaun.org.uk/community-climate-fund/), because we didn‘t provide any evidence of habitat _improvement_. However, Tom was really helfpul with feedback. I‘m involved in another group called [Glaswelltir Ceredigion Grassland](https://glaswelltirceredigion.cymru/), and fed this feedback into an application for [Dŵr Cymru‘s Citizen Science Support Programme](https://corporate.dwrcymru.com/en/community/environment/citizen-science-support-programme), with a Hope Garden-inspired project called Grassland Nature ID.

The good news is that this application has been successful, and through talking to various people, the Hope Garden has managed to secure free grassland nature ID workshops from [Plantlife Cymru](https://www.plantlife.org.uk/about-us/plantlife-cymru/). We‘ve checked with Heritage Trust, who administer our grant, and they‘re supportive of us purchasing wildlife ID equipment for the school. 

Next stop will be shopping at NHBS for the wildlife ID equipment, such as nets, lenses and inspection chambers.
