As it says in the footer on the website, the Hope Garden is 

> Funded by [Local Places for Nature](https://www.heritagefund.org.uk/funding/local-places-nature), delivered by [National Lottery Heritage Fund](https://www.heritagefund.org.uk/) in partnership with the [Welsh Government](https://www.gov.wales/local-places-nature-programme)

And what we’re doing is to create that local place with low-cost materials, that local place being a canvas shelter with a storage unit for benches and to hang up coats. It‘s an *outdoor classroom*, a *workshop space*, a *social gathering out-of-the-rain* refuge for the allotmenteers. And all of these uses are focussed around learning about wildlife.

The school is running workshops aligned with the [Grassland Nature ID project](https://glaswelltirceredigion.cymru/grassland-nature-id/), and will hopefully use the space on a regular basis. They also helped *design* the space too, with a design workshop last year, and they‘ll be running the [IntMintMint Challenge](https://hopegarden.uk/blog/241023-mintopia/) too with the hex beds.

I would like to run forest garden workshops later in the year, to bring some money in to cover running costs of [Garden Wild Plants CIC](https://gardenwild.org.uk).

We‘re very lucky to have Phil Blackwood from [BlueGreenCymru](https://www.bluegreencymru.com) building the canvas shelter; they run numerous well-being outdoor workshops, so are ideally positioned to know what is required from the space. 

The plan is to have plans under the [toolkit](https://hopegarden.uk/toolkit/) section, so that the low-cost canvas shelter and pallet storage unit can be easily built by other community groups.

Here‘s a screenshot of the PDF for the canvas shelter (it’s still a work in progress!)

And here‘s a screenshot of the CAD I’ve creatd for the storage unit made out of pallets, stakes and [Corroline roofing sheets](https://www.arielplastics.com/en-gb/products/bitumen-roofing-sheet/coroline-sheet-and-accessories/coroline-bitumen-roofing-sheet.aspx):

I feel bad because originally the storage unit was going to be a beautiful round wood structure with a green roof made by the very talented woodworker [David Hunter](https://thecoppiceplot.com). But it was just too expensive, in time and materials, so I‘ve asked him to make something far more prosaic.
