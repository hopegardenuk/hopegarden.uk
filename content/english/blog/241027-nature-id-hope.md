Together with [West Wales Biodiversity Information Centre](https://www.wwbic.org.uk/), we’ve made a Expression of Interest for wildlife identification equipment and training for Ysgol Cilgerran from [Transition Bro Gwaun Community Climate Fund](https://transitionbrogwaun.org.uk/community-climate-fund/).

It’s a brilliant project, equipping and training children and staff at the school to identify nature. They get to learn about plants, invertebrates, birds, mammals, fungi - what they eat and where they live. WWBIC get regular observations. The Hope Garden gets *used* on a regular basis, as an outdoor classroom. Which also means it gets *maintained*. 

The cost of the equipment is about £300 and the half dozen workshops are costing about £700.

We find out next March if we’re successful.
